# GMP pickup document

The solidity implementation of `ICS27GMP` is feature complete. The next steps are all about testing and auditing.

- Add end to end tests for the timeouts and error acknowledgements.
- If any further changes are made to the IBC-Go implementation, update the solidity code accordingly.
- Internal audit of the solidity code.
