# Solana Light Client

This package contains the core Solana light client implementation for IBC.

## Overview

The Solana light client provides IBC client functionality for verifying Solana chain state and facilitating cross-chain communication with Cosmos-based chains.

## Key Components

- **ClientState**: Solana chain parameters and configuration
- **ConsensusState**: Trusted Solana chain state at specific heights
- **Header**: Solana block/account state information for updates
- **Verification**: Logic to verify client messages and state transitions
- **Updates**: Logic to update consensus state with new Solana data

## Initial Implementation Focus

This initial implementation focuses on:
1. Basic client state management
2. Consensus state updates using Solana account data
3. Simple verification of account state transitions
4. Integration with IBC verify_client_message and update_state methods

Note: Advanced features like merkle proof verification for membership proofs are not included in the initial implementation.
