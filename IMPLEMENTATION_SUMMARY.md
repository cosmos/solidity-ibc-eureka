# Implementation Summary: GitHub Workflow for local_node.sh

## What Was Created

I've created a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow to test the `local_node.sh` script in the [zchn/cosmos-evm](https://github.com/zchn/cosmos-evm) repository. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. GitHub Workflow (`.github/workflows/test-local-node.yml`)

A complete CI/CD workflow that:
- ✅ Automatically tests `local_node.sh` on every push and PR
- ✅ Runs on multiple Ubuntu versions for compatibility
- ✅ Installs all necessary dependencies (Go, Node.js, system packages)
- ✅ Validates script syntax and best practices
- ✅ Executes the script with proper timeout handling
- ✅ Performs comprehensive health checks on the running node
- ✅ Tests all major endpoints (RPC, EVM RPC, gRPC, API)
- ✅ Captures and uploads logs for debugging
- ✅ Properly cleans up resources after testing

### 2. Sample local_node.sh Script

Since the actual script wasn't available, I created a reference implementation that demonstrates:
- ✅ Proper error handling and exit codes
- ✅ Dependency checking
- ✅ Port availability validation
- ✅ Node initialization and configuration
- ✅ Genesis setup with validator account
- ✅ Health check verification
- ✅ Clean shutdown handling

### 3. Documentation

- **README-github-workflow.md**: Comprehensive guide on using and customizing the workflow
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: This file, explaining the implementation

## How to Use in zchn/cosmos-evm

### Step 1: Add the Workflow to Your Repository

1. Copy the workflow file to your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp .github/workflows/test-local-node.yml <path-to-zchn-cosmos-evm>/.github/workflows/
   ```

2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   cd <path-to-zchn-cosmos-evm>
   git add .github/workflows/test-local-node.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub workflow to test local_node.sh"
   git push
   ```

### Step 2: Ensure Your local_node.sh Is Compatible

The workflow expects `local_node.sh` to:
1. Be located in the repository root
2. Be executable (`chmod +x local_node.sh`)
3. Start a node that listens on standard ports
4. Exit with proper error codes on failure

### Step 3: Customize If Needed

If your `local_node.sh` uses different ports or configurations:

1. Edit the workflow file's port checks:
   ```yaml
   # Update port numbers in these sections:
   - "Check node health"
   - "Test EVM RPC endpoints"
   - "Test gRPC endpoints"
   ```

2. Adjust timeout if your node takes longer to start:
   ```yaml
   timeout-minutes: 10  # Increase this value
   ```

3. Add any additional dependencies your script requires:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install system dependencies
     run: |
       sudo apt-get install -y \
         # ... existing deps ...
         your-additional-dependency
   ```

## Key Features of the Workflow

### 1. Smart Triggering
- Only runs when relevant files change
- Supports manual triggering for testing
- Runs on main branches and PRs

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- Validates script syntax before execution
- Tests multiple endpoints automatically
- Verifies block production
- Checks for common errors in logs

### 3. Debugging Support
- Uploads logs as artifacts
- Collects system information on failure
- Provides clear error messages

### 4. Best Practices
- Uses caching for faster runs
- Parallel job execution where possible
- Proper cleanup to avoid resource leaks
- ShellCheck integration for code quality

## Expected Workflow Behavior

When the workflow runs, it will:

1. **Set up the environment** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Run local_node.sh** (timeout after 10 minutes)
3. **Wait for node to be ready** (max 5 minutes)
4. **Run health checks** (~1 minute)
5. **Clean up resources** (~30 seconds)

Total expected runtime: 5-10 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### If the workflow fails:

1. **Check the Actions tab** in GitHub for detailed logs
2. **Download artifacts** to see full node logs
3. **Review common issues**:
   - Port conflicts
   - Missing dependencies
   - Insufficient permissions
   - Script syntax errors

### To test locally before pushing:

```bash
# Test script syntax
bash -n local_node.sh

# Run the script
./local_node.sh

# Check if node is healthy
curl http://localhost:26657/status
```

## Next Steps

1. **Copy the workflow** to your repository
2. **Test it** by pushing to a feature branch
3. **Monitor the Actions tab** for results
4. **Customize** based on your specific needs
5. **Add more tests** as your project evolves

## Benefits

- ✅ **Automated Testing**: No manual testing needed
- ✅ **Early Detection**: Catch issues before merging
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same tests run every time
- ✅ **Documentation**: Workflow serves as documentation
- ✅ **Debugging**: Logs help diagnose issues quickly

## Conclusion

This GitHub workflow provides a robust testing framework for the `local_node.sh` script. It ensures that the script works correctly across different environments and helps maintain code quality through automated testing.
