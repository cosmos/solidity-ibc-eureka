# End to End Testing Suite with Interchaintest

The e2e tests are built using the [interchaintest](https://github.com/cosmos/interchaintest) library. It runs multiple docker container validators, and lets you test IBC enabled smart contracts.

These end to end tests are designed to run in the CI, but you can also run them locally.

## Running the tests locally

### Prerequisites

Besu tests additionally require Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`).

In the repo root:

```
cp .env.example .env
just install-proof-api && just solidity::install-operator
```

### Run tests

To run the tests locally, run the following commands from the repo root:

```shell
# Run the following where `$TEST_NAME` is one of the test names of the `$TEST_SUITE_FN`:
just test-e2e $TEST_SUITE_FN/$TEST_NAME

# For example, to run the `TestDeploy` test, you would run:
just test-e2e TestWithIbcEurekaTestSuite/Test_Deploy

# Alternatively:
just test-e2e-eureka Test_Deploy
```

## Besu QBFT mode

Set `ETH_TESTNET_TYPE=besu-qbft` to start a real 4-validator Besu QBFT network.

### Supported in this mode

This pass supports the following Besu configuration:

- `ETH_TESTNET_TYPE=besu-qbft`
- `ETH_LC_ON_COSMOS=attestor-native`
- `COSMOS_LC_ON_ETH=sp1`
- `SP1_PROVER=mock`

Validated coverage in this mode:

- Besu chain bring-up and contract deployment
- Dockerized Ethereum attestors reading Besu RPC
- relayer startup and client creation
- full Ethereum ↔ Cosmos ICS20 transfer roundtrip

### Not supported

- `ETH_LC_ON_COSMOS=full`
- beacon-chain-based Ethereum verification on Cosmos

### Focused local test commands

From the repo root, run:

```shell
# Full ICS20 roundtrip in the supported Besu mode
ETH_TESTNET_TYPE=besu-qbft \
ETH_LC_ON_COSMOS=attestor-native \
COSMOS_LC_ON_ETH=sp1 \
SP1_PROVER=mock \
just test-e2e TestWithIbcEurekaTestSuite/Test_ICS20TransferERC20TokenfromEthereumToCosmosAndBack
```

## Focused Besu ↔ Besu e2e

This focused suite starts two independent Besu networks, deploys Eureka contracts on both, starts the Rust relayer with `besu_to_eth` in both directions, deploys and registers Besu light clients on both chains, and verifies a one-way A → B ICS20 transfer plus the B → A acknowledgement relay using real Besu proofs.

Every test runs once per consensus protocol: the `_QBFT` variant starts QBFT networks and the `_IBFT2` variant starts IBFT 2.0 networks. Each test starts its own networks and relayer.

### Focused local test commands

From the repo root, run:

```shell
# Dual-Besu deploy / client-registration path
just test-e2e TestWithBesuToBesuTestSuite/Test_Deploy_QBFT
just test-e2e TestWithBesuToBesuTestSuite/Test_Deploy_IBFT2

# One-way Besu A -> Besu B ICS20 transfer with acknowledgement relay back to A
just test-e2e TestWithBesuToBesuTestSuite/Test_ICS20TransferERC20FromChainAToChainB_QBFT

# Besu A -> Besu B ICS20 timeout with a packet-receipt non-membership proof
just test-e2e TestWithBesuToBesuTestSuite/Test_TimeoutICS20TransferERC20FromChainAToChainB_IBFT2

# Batched variants: 5 packets per relay tx, only the first carries the account proof (cached storage root)
just test-e2e TestWithBesuToBesuTestSuite/Test_5_ICS20TransferERC20FromChainAToChainB_QBFT
just test-e2e TestWithBesuToBesuTestSuite/Test_5_TimeoutICS20TransferERC20FromChainAToChainB_IBFT2

# Regenerate the QBFT and IBFT2 light-client fixtures used by test/besu-bft/*
just solidity::generate-fixtures-besu
```

The fixture command runs the focused Besu↔Besu transfer tests with
`GENERATE_BESU_LIGHT_CLIENT_FIXTURES=true` and writes:

- `ibc-solidity/test/besu-bft/fixtures/qbft.json`
- `ibc-solidity/test/besu-bft/fixtures/ibft2.json`
