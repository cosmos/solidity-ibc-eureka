### SP1 Programs for the Light Client

|     **Programs**    |                                                                                                                                     **Description**                                                                                                                                     | **Status** |
|:-------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|   `update-client`   | Once the initial client state and consensus state are submitted, future consensus states can be added to the client by submitting IBC Headers. These headers contain all necessary information to run the Comet BFT Light Client protocol. Also supports partial misbehavior check.     |      ✅     |
|     `membership`    | As consensus states are added to the client, they can be used for proof verification by relayers wishing to prove packet flow messages against a particular height on the counterparty. This uses the `verify_membership` and `verify_non_membership` methods on the tendermint client. |      ✅     |
| `uc-and-membership` | This is a program that combines `update-client` and `membership` to update the client, and prove membership of packet flow messages against the new consensus state.                                                                                                                    |      ✅     |
|    `misbehaviour`   | In case, the malicious subset of the validators exceeds the trust level of the client; then the client can be deceived into accepting invalid blocks and the connection is no longer secure. The tendermint client has some mitigations in place to prevent this.                       |      ✅     |

### Solana Programs

| **Programs** | **Description** | **Status** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `access-manager` | A central contract to store the permissions of a system. | ✅ |
| `attestation` | The multisig contract implementing IBC Light Client specs. | ✅ |
| `ics07-tendermint` | ICS-07 tendermint light client, powered by tendermint-rs | ✅ |
| `ics26-router` | IBC router handles sequencing, replay protection, and timeout checks. Passes proofs to light clients for verification, and resolves `portId` for app callbacks. Provable IBC storage is stored in this contract. | ✅ |

## Build Requirements

### Ethereum Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/introduction/installation)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install) (_Note: Homebrew installations of rust may fail here_)
- [Protobuf compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage contract dependencies, but this repository uses Node.js packages (via Bun) because submodules don't scale. You can install the contracts dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
cd ibc-solidity && bun install
```

You also need to have the operator and proof API binaries installed on your machine to run some of the end-to-end tests. You can install them by running the following commands:

```sh
just solidity::install-operator
just install-proof-api
```

> [!TIP]
> Nix users can enter a development shell with all the necessary dependencies by running:
>
> ```sh
> nix develop
> ```

### EVM Deployment Requirements

The Solidity contracts are compiled for the **Cancun** EVM and rely on EIP-1153 transient storage at runtime (`ReentrancyGuardTransient` in the router and apps, and transient proof caches in the SP1 Tendermint and Besu light clients). Deploy them only to chains with the Cancun hard fork enabled; on a pre-Cancun chain, packet handling and proof verification revert with an invalid opcode. See [`ibc-solidity/contracts/README.md`](./ibc-solidity/contracts/README.md) and the [Besu light client README](./ibc-solidity/contracts/light-clients/besu/README.md#destination-evm-requirements).

### Solana Requirements

- [Rust 1.89.0](https://rustup.rs/) (selected automatically by `ibc-solana/rust-toolchain.toml`)
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)
- [Agave](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)
- [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/)

If you have Anchor installed locally, you can use the standard commands:

```sh
just solana::build-solana-programs
just solana::test-solana
```

List every Solana-specific recipe with:

```sh
just solana
```

Or directly:

```sh
cd ibc-solana
anchor build
anchor test
anchor deploy
```

> [!TIP]
> Nix users can enter a solana development shell with all the necessary dependencies by running:
>
> ```sh
> nix develop .#solana
> ```
>
> Then navigate to the Solana programs directory and use anchor-nix commands:
>
> ```sh
> cd ibc-solana
> anchor-nix build
> anchor-nix test
> anchor-nix deploy
> ```

### Solana Programs

For detailed information about Solana IBC programs including deployment, key generation, access control, and upgradability, see the **[Solana Programs README](ibc-solana/README.md)**.

## Unit Testing

There are multiple unit tests for the solidity contracts located in the `ibc-solidity/test/` directory. The tests are written in Solidity using [foundry/forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests).

To run all the tests, run the following command:

```sh
just solidity::test-foundry
```

The recipe also accepts a `testname` argument that will only run the test with the given name. For example:

```shell
just solidity::test-foundry test_success_sendTransfer
```

## End to End Testing

There are several end-to-end tests in the `e2e/interchaintestv8` directory. These tests are written in Go and use the [`interchaintest`](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest) library.
It spins up a local Ethereum and a Tendermint network and runs the tests found in [`e2e/interchaintestv8/ibc_eureka_test.go`](e2e/interchaintestv8/ibc_eureka_test.go).
Some of the tests use the prover network to generate the proofs, so you need to provide your SP1 network private key to `.env` for these tests to pass.

### Requirements

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/)
  - Needs to be the same version as `github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/api/golang` dependency in e2e [`go.mod`](./e2e/interchaintestv8/go.mod) file.

To prepare for running the e2e tests, you need to make sure you have done the following:
- Set up an .env file (see the instructions in the `.env.example` file)
- If you have made changes to the contract interfaces or types, you need to update the ABIs by running `just solidity::generate-abi`

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running on a Mac with an M chip, you will need to do the following:
>
> - Set up Rosetta
> - Enable Rosetta for Docker (in Docker Desktop: Settings -> General -> enable "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon")
> - Pull the foundry image with the following command:
>
>     ```sh
>     docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest
>     ```

### Running the tests

There are five test suites in the `e2e/interchaintestv8` directory:

- `TestWithIbcEurekaTestSuite`: This test suite tests the IBC contracts via the proof API (requires the operator and the proof API to be installed).
  - To run any of the tests, run the following command:

        ```sh
        just test-e2e-eureka $TEST_NAME
        ```

- `TestWithProofAPITestSuite`: This test suite tests the proof API via the IBC contracts (requires the proof API and operator to be installed).
  - To run any of the tests, run the following command:

        ```sh
        just test-e2e-proof-api $TEST_NAME
        ```

- `TestWithCosmosProofAPITestSuite`: This test suite tests the proof API via Cosmos to Cosmos connections (requires the proof API and operator to be installed).
  - To run any of the tests, run the following command:

        ```sh
        just test-e2e-cosmos-proof-api $TEST_NAME
        ```

- `TestWithSP1ICS07TendermintTestSuite`: This test suite tests the SP1 ICS07 Tendermint light client (requires the operator to be installed).
  - To run any of the tests, run the following command:

        ```sh
        just test-e2e-sp1-ics07 $TEST_NAME
        ```

- `TestWithMultichainTestSuite`: This test suite tests multi-chain transfers with Ethereum and multiple Cosmos chains (requires the proof API and operator to be installed).
  - To run any of the tests, run the following command:

        ```sh
        just test-e2e-multichain $TEST_NAME
        ```

## Development

You may need these additional tools to develop on this project:

- [Natlint](https://docs.rs/crate/natlint/latest)
- [Abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/tools/abigen)
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/#local-installation)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/)

```sh
just lint
```

## Benchmarks

The generated [Solidity benchmark tables](./ibc-solidity/benchmarks/README.md) include SP1 Tendermint end-to-end packet costs and direct Besu QBFT light-client operation costs. Their machine-readable gas snapshots are committed alongside the tables so benchmark changes are visible in GitHub diffs.

## Security Assumptions

IBC is a peer-to-peer, light-client-based interoperability protocol. This repository contains the following light clients:

- **SP1 Tendermint Light Client** – Verifies the consensus state of a Cosmos SDK chain powered by SP1 and `tendermint-rs`. (Solidity)
- **Besu IBFT 2.0 / QBFT Light Clients** – Verify Besu BFT headers in header-validator mode, track the counterparty chain state root, and verify EVM account/storage proofs for Eureka commitments. (Solidity)
- [**Ethereum Light Client**](./ibc-solidity/programs/cw-ics08-wasm-eth/README.md) – Verifies the consensus state of the Ethereum chain. (CosmWasm)
- **Attestation Light Client** – A multisig that can be used if the counterparty chain does not have a light client protocol. (Solidity and Solana)
- **Solana Tendermint Light Client** - Verifies the consensus state of a Cosmos SDK chain powered by `tendermint-rs`. (Solana)

The security of an IBC connection depends on the integrity of these light clients and the validator sets of the respective chains. However, IBC light clients can become **frozen** under certain conditions, such as:

- Detection of two conflicting valid headers.
- Failure to update the light client for an extended period.

### Handling Frozen Light Clients

When a light client freezes, Cosmos SDK chains rely on **governance** to restart the client. However, Ethereum and Solana lack a native governance mechanism for this purpose. **To address this, the Solidity and Solana implementations of IBC requires a timelocked Security Council to restart the light client in case of a freeze.**

Additionally, the Security Council is responsible for:

- **Upgrading IBC contracts** in the event of a security vulnerability.
- **Introducing new features** while balancing security and decentralization.

Ideally, the Security Council should mirror the validators of the counterparty Cosmos SDK chain for better decentralization. In the future, a mechanism called **`govAdmin`** will allow the Cosmos SDK chain’s governance to directly control Ethereum contract upgrades via IBC (tracked in [#278](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/issues/278)).

### Security Council and Governance Admin

Although **`govAdmin`** is not yet implemented, the contract tracking both admins is [`AccessManager`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.3.0/contracts/access/manager/AccessManager.sol). We require that the both admins are granted the admin role on `AccessManager.sol`:

- **`timelockedAdmin`** (Security Council)
- **`govAdmin`** (Governance Admin)

Other IBC contracts that require access control or upgradability should reference [`AccessManager`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.3.0/contracts/access/manager/AccessManager.sol).

#### Admin Powers and Restrictions

Until **govAdmin** is implemented, the **Security Council** remains the sole administrator. Under the `AccessManager` contract, all admins have **equal authority**, including the ability to:

- Assign or modify the other admin.
- Manage roles on IBC contracts.
- Upgrade IBC contracts. Learn more about [upgrading the Solidity contracts](./UPGRADEABILITY.md).

#### Key Distinction Between Admins

The Security Council must **apply a timelock** to itself. This ensures that after delegation, the Security Council only retains power in cases where IBC light clients are **frozen**—effectively making **govAdmin** the primary administrator in normal conditions.

> [!WARNING]
>
> - The timelock on the **Security Council** is **not** enforced within the IBC contracts but should be self-enforced.
> - The timelock duration should be at least as long as:
>   - The **govAdmin** timelock (if applicable).
>   - The time required for governance proposals to pass.

### Roles and Permissions

The IBC solidity contracts use [`AccessManager`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.3.0/contracts/access/manager/AccessManager.sol) to manage roles and permissions and allow the admins to reassign roles. All the roles are defined in [`IBCRolesLib.sol`](./ibc-solidity/contracts/utils/IBCRolesLib.sol):

| **Role Name** | **Role Id** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `ADMIN_ROLE` | 0 | Can grant and set target functions for all roles. |
| `RELAYER_ROLE` | 1 | Whitelisted relayer addresses. |
| `PAUSER_ROLE` | 2 | Can pause the IBC application contracts. |
| `UNPAUSER_ROLE` | 3 | Can unpause the IBC application contract. |
| `DELEGATE_SENDER_ROLE` | 4 | Has permission to call `sendTransferWithSender`. |
| `RATE_LIMITER_ROLE` | 5 | Can set withdrawal rate limits per `ERC20` token. |
| `ID_CUSTOMIZER_ROLE` | 6 | Can set custom client and port ids for applications. |
| `ERC20_CUSTOMIZER_ROLE` | 7 | Can set custom `ERC20` contracts for non-native tokens instead of the default `IBCERC20`. |
| `PUBLIC_ROLE` | `type(uint64).max` | A role that everyone has by default. |
