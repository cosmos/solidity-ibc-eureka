### Contracts

| **Contracts** | **Description** | **Status** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `ICS26Router.sol` | IBC router handles sequencing, replay protection, and timeout checks. Passes proofs to light clients for verification, and resolves `portId` for app callbacks. Provable IBC storage is stored in this contract.  | ✅ |
| `ICS20Transfer.sol` | IBC transfer application to send and receive tokens to/from another IBC transfer implementation. | ✅ |
| `SP1ICS07Tendermint.sol` | The light client contract, and the entry point for SP1 proofs. | ✅ |
| `ICS27Controller.sol` | IBC interchain accounts controller. | ❌ |
| `ICS27Host.sol` | IBC interchain accounts host. | ❌ |

### SP1 Programs for the Light Client

|     **Programs**    |                                                                                                                                     **Description**                                                                                                                                     | **Status** |
|:-------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------:|
|   `update-client`   | Once the initial client state and consensus state are submitted, future consensus states can be added to the client by submitting IBC Headers. These headers contain all necessary information to run the Comet BFT Light Client protocol. Also supports partial misbehavior check.     |      ✅     |
|     `membership`    | As consensus states are added to the client, they can be used for proof verification by relayers wishing to prove packet flow messages against a particular height on the counterparty. This uses the `verify_membership` and `verify_non_membership` methods on the tendermint client. |      ✅     |
| `uc-and-membership` | This is a program that combines `update-client` and `membership` to update the client, and prove membership of packet flow messages against the new consensus state.                                                                                                                    |      ✅     |
|    `misbehaviour`   | In case, the malicious subset of the validators exceeds the trust level of the client; then the client can be deceived into accepting invalid blocks and the connection is no longer secure. The tendermint client has some mitigations in place to prevent this.                       |      ✅     |


## Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/)
- [SP1](https://succinctlabs.github.io/sp1/getting-started/install.html) (for end-to-end tests)

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage contract dependencies, but this repository uses Node.js packages (via Bun) because submodules don't scale. You can install the contracts dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
bun install
```

You also need to have the operator and relayer binaries installed on your machine to run some of the end-to-end tests. You can install them by running the following commands:

```sh
just install-operator
just install-relayer
```

> [!TIP]
> Nix users can enter a development shell with all the necessary dependencies by running:
> 
> ```sh
> nix develop
> ```

## Unit Testing

There are multiple unit tests for the solidity contracts located in the `test/` directory. The tests are written in Solidity using [foundry/forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests).

To run all the tests, run the following command:

```sh
just test-foundry
```

The recipe also accepts a `testname` argument that will only run the test with the given name. For example:

```shell
just test-foundry test_success_sendTransfer
```

## End to End Testing

There are several end-to-end tests in the `e2e/interchaintestv8` directory. These tests are written in Go and use the [`interchaintest`](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest) library. 
It spins up a local Ethereum and a Tendermint network and runs the tests found in [`e2e/interchaintestv8/ibc_eureka_test.go`](e2e/interchaintestv8/ibc_eureka_test.go). 
Some of the tests use the prover network to generate the proofs, so you need to provide your SP1 network private key to `.env` for these tests to pass.

To prepare for running the e2e tests, you need to make sure you have done the following:
* Installed the `sp1-ics07-tendermint` operator binary (see instructions above)
* Set up an .env file (see the instructions in the `.env.example` file)
* If you have made changes to the contract interfaces or types, you need to update the ABIs by running `just generate-abi`

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running on a Mac with an M chip, you will need to do the following:
> - Set up Rosetta
> - Enable Rosetta for Docker (in Docker Desktop: Settings -> General -> enable "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon")
> - Pull the foundry image with the following command:
> 
>     ```sh
>     docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest
>     ```

### Running the tests

There are five test suites in the `e2e/interchaintestv8` directory:

- `TestWithIbcEurekaTestSuite`: This test suite tests the IBC contracts via the relayer (requires the operator and the relayer to be installed).
    - To run any of the tests, run the following command:
        ```sh
        just test-e2e $TEST_NAME
        ```
- `TestWithRelayerTestSuite`: This test suite tests the relayer via the IBC contracts (requires the relayer and operator to be installed).
    - To run any of the tests, run the following command:
        ```sh
        just test-e2e-relayer $TEST_NAME
        ```
- `TestWithCosmosRelayerTestSuite`: This test suite tests the relayer via Cosmos to Cosmos connections (requires the relayer and operator to be installed).
    - To run any of the tests, run the following command:
        ```sh
        just test-e2e-cosmos-relayer $TEST_NAME
        ```
- `TestWithSP1ICS07TendermintTestSuite`: This test suite tests the SP1 ICS07 Tendermint light client (requires the operator to be installed).
    - To run any of the tests, run the following command:
        ```sh
        just test-e2e-sp1-ics07 $TEST_NAME
        ```
- `TestWithMultichainTestSuite`: This test suite tests multi-chain transfers with Ethereum and multiple Cosmos chains (requires the relayer and operator to be installed).
    - To run any of the tests, run the following command:
        ```sh
        just test-e2e-multichain $TEST_NAME
        ```

Where `$TEST_NAME` is the name of the test you want to run, for example:

```sh
just test-e2e TestDeploy_Groth16
```

## Linting

Before committing, you should lint your code to ensure it follows the style guide. You can do this by running the following command:

```sh
just lint
```

## End to End Benchmarks

The contracts in this repository are benchmarked end-to-end using foundry. The following benchmarks were ran with the underlying [sp1-ics07-tendermint](https://github.com/cosmos/sp1-ics07-tendermint). About ~230,000 gas is used for each light client verification (groth16), and this is included in the gas costs below for `recvPacket`, `timeoutPacket` and `ackPacket`. At the time of writing, proof generation takes around 1 minute. More granular and in-depth benchmarks are planned for the future.

### Single Packet Benchmarks

The following benchmarks are for a single packet transfer without aggregation.

| **Contract** | **Method** | **Description** | **Gas (groth16)** | **Gas (plonk)** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `ICS26Router.sol` | `sendPacket` | Initiating an IBC transfer with an `ERC20`. | ~150,000 | ~150,000 |
| `ICS26Router.sol` | `recvPacket` | Receiving _back_ an `ERC20` token. | ~509,542 | ~592,518 |
| `ICS26Router.sol` | `recvPacket` | Receiving a _new_ Cosmos token for the first time. (Deploying an `ERC20` contract) | ~1,079,133 | ~1,163,441 |
| `ICS26Router.sol` | `ackPacket` | Acknowledging an ICS20 packet. | ~393,224 | ~477,022 |
| `ICS26Router.sol` | `timeoutPacket` | Timing out an ICS20 packet | ~465,360 | ~549,821 |

### Aggregated Packet Benchmarks

The gas costs are substantially lower when aggregating multiple packets into a single proof, as long as the packets are submitted in the same tx.
Since there is no meaningful difference in gas costs between plonk and groth16 in the aggregated case, they are not separated in the table below.

| **ICS26Router Method** | **Description** | **Avg Gas (25 packets)** | **Avg Gas (50 packets)** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `multicall/recvPacket` | Receiving _back_ an `ERC20` token. | ~170,301 | ~163,748 |
| `multicall/ackPacket` | Acknowledging an ICS20 packet. | ~92,137 | ~86,432 |

Note: These gas benchmarks are with Groth16.

## Run ICS-07 Tendermint Light Client End to End

1. Set the environment variables by filling in the `.env` file with the following:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    You need to fill in the `PRIVATE_KEY`, `SP1_PROVER`, `TENDERMINT_RPC_URL`, and `RPC_URL`. You also need the `NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY` field if you are using the SP1 prover network.

2. Deploy the `SP1ICS07Tendermint` contract:

    ```sh
    just deploy-sp1-ics07
    ```

    This will generate the `contracts/script/genesis.json` file which contains the initialization parameters for the contract. And then deploy the contract using `contracts/script/SP1ICS07Tendermint.s.sol`.
    If you see the following error, add `--legacy` to the command in the `justfile`:
    ```text
    Error: Failed to get EIP-1559 fees    
    ```

3. Your deployed contract address will be printed to the terminal.

    ```text
    == Return ==
    0: address <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
    ```

    This will be used when you run the operator in step 5. So add this to your `.env` file.

    ```.env
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
    ```

4. Run the Tendermint operator.

    To run the operator, you need to select the prover type for SP1. This is set in the `.env` file with the `SP1_PROVER` value (`network|local|mock`).
    If you run the operator with the `network` prover, you need to provide your SP1 network private key with `NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY=0xyourprivatekey` in `.env`.

    ```sh
    RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin operator --release -- start
    ```

## Security Assumptions

IBC is a peer-to-peer, light-client-based interoperability protocol. This repository contains two light clients:

- **SP1 Light Client** – Verifies the consensus state of a Cosmos SDK chain.
- [**Ethereum Light Client**](./programs/cw-ics08-wasm-eth/README.md) – Verifies the consensus state of the Ethereum chain.

The security of an IBC connection depends on the integrity of these light clients and the validator sets of the respective chains. However, IBC light clients can become **frozen** under certain conditions, such as:

- Detection of two conflicting valid headers.
- Failure to update the light client for an extended period.

### Handling Frozen Light Clients

When a light client freezes, Cosmos SDK chains rely on **governance** to restart the client. However, Ethereum lacks a native governance mechanism for this purpose. **To address this, the Solidity implementation of IBC requires a timelocked Security Council to restart the light client in case of a freeze.**

Additionally, the Security Council is responsible for:

- **Upgrading IBC contracts** in the event of a security vulnerability.
- **Introducing new features** while balancing security and decentralization.

Ideally, the Security Council should mirror the validators of the counterparty Cosmos SDK chain for better decentralization. In the future, a mechanism called **`govAdmin`** will allow the Cosmos SDK chain’s governance to directly control Ethereum contract upgrades via IBC (tracked in [#278](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/issues/278)).

### Security Council and Governance Admin

Although **`govAdmin`** is not yet implemented, the contract tracking both admins is [`IBCUUPSUpgradeable.sol`](./contracts/utils/IBCUUPSUpgradeable.sol). This contract is inherited by [`ICS26Router.sol`](./contracts/ICS26Router.sol), which maintains:

- **`timelockedAdmin`** (Security Council)
- **`govAdmin`** (Governance Admin)

Other IBC contracts that require administrative access or upgradability should reference `ICS26Router` to retrieve the current admin. For example, see its implementation in [`ICS20Transfer.sol`](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/blob/1db4d38d00f7935e2aa4564b7026182a4c095ef1/contracts/ICS20Transfer.sol#L487-L492).

#### Admin Powers and Restrictions

Until **govAdmin** is implemented, the **Security Council** remains the sole administrator. Under the `IBCUUPSUpgradeable` contract, both admins will eventually have **equal authority**, including the ability to:

- Assign or modify the other admin.
- Manage roles on IBC contracts.
- Upgrade IBC contracts. Learn more about [upgrading the Solidity contracts](./UPGRADEABILITY.md).

#### Key Distinction Between Admins

Once the **govAdmin** is set, the Security Council must **apply a timelock** to itself. This ensures that after delegation, the Security Council only retains power in cases where IBC light clients are **frozen**—effectively making **govAdmin** the primary administrator in normal conditions.

> [!WARNING]
> - The timelock on the **Security Council** is **not** enforced within the IBC contracts but should be self-enforced.
> - The timelock duration should be at least as long as:
>   - The **govAdmin** timelock (if applicable).
>   - The time required for governance proposals to pass.

### Roles and Permissions

The IBC contracts use `AccessControl` to manage roles and permissions and allow the admins to reassign roles. The roles are:

| **Role Name** | **Contract** | **Default** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `PAUSER_ROLE` | `ICS20Transfer.sol` | Set at initialization. | Can pause/unpause the contract. |
| `RATE_LIMITER_ROLE` | `Escrow.sol` | `address(0)` | Can set withdrawal rate limits per `ERC20` token. |
| `LIGHT_CLIENT_MIGRATOR_ROLE_{client_id}` | `ICS26Router.sol` | Creator of the light client. | Can migrate the light client identified by `client_id`. |
