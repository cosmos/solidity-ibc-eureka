A WIP IBC Eureka implementation in Solidity. IBC Eureka is a simplified version of the IBC protocol that is encoding agnostic.

## Installing Dependencies

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage dependencies, but this template uses Node.js packages because
[submodules don't scale](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1736695487057531328).

This is how to install dependencies:

1. Install the dependency using your preferred package manager, e.g. `bun install dependency-name`
   - Use this syntax to install from GitHub: `bun install github:username/repo-name`
2. Add a remapping for the dependency in [remappings.txt](./remappings.txt), e.g.
   `dependency-name=node_modules/dependency-name`

Note that OpenZeppelin Contracts is pre-installed, so you can follow that as an example.

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies:

```sh
$ bun install
```

### Build

Build/compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```sh
$ forge test
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) tutorial.

### Format

Format the contracts:

```sh
$ forge fmt
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

Lint the contracts:

```sh
$ bun run lint
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

Generate test coverage and output result to the terminal:

```sh
$ bun run test:coverage
```

Generate test coverage with lcov report (you'll have to open the `./coverage/index.html` file in your browser, to do so
simply copy paste the path):

```sh
$ bun run test:coverage:report
```
