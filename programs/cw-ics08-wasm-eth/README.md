# cw-ics08-wasm-eth
> âš  The Ethereum Light Client is currently under heavy development, is expected to change and is not ready for production use.

This is the CosmWasm implementation that can be used with ibc-go's 08-wasm light client wrapper. 
It handles the client and consensus state, and calls into `packages/ethereum-light-client` for all the light client related logic.

## Acknowledgements
This work is based on the ethereum light client created by [Union](http://github.com/unionlabs/union/)
