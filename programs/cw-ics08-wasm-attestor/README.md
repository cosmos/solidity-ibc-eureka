# CosmWasm ICS-08 Wasm Attestor Client

This CosmWasm smart contract implements the ICS-08 Wasm light client interface for generic attestation clients.

## Overview

This contract provides the CosmWasm wrapper around a generic attestation client, enabling IBC connections between Cosmos chains and various blockchain clients. It implements the standard IBC light client interface through CosmWasm entry points.

## Entry Points

### Instantiate
- Initializes the attestor client with initial client state and consensus state

### Query
- **verify_client_message**: Validates client messages (headers)
- **check_for_misbehaviour**: Checks for misbehavior in client messages (TODO)
- **timestamp_at_height**: Returns timestamp at a given height
- **status**: Returns client status (Active/Frozen/Expired)

### Sudo
- **update_state**: Updates the client and consensus state with new blockchain data
- **verify_membership**: Verifies membership proofs (TODO in initial implementation)
- **verify_non_membership**: Verifies non-membership proofs (TODO in initial implementation)
- **update_state_on_misbehaviour**: Handles misbehavior by freezing client (TODO)

## Initial Implementation Scope

The initial implementation focuses on:
1. Basic client instantiation
2. Header verification (verify_client_message)
3. State updates (update_state)
4. Simple status queries

Advanced features like membership proof verification will be added in subsequent iterations.
